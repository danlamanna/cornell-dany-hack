**** ImageSpace is an application for browsing through images and their metadata
**** ImageSpace can use SMQTK to perform nearest neighbors on images

* SMQTK
**** SMQTK is a toolkit for multimedia-based machine learning
**** More: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK
* Up and running
**** ImageSpace and SMQTK can be setup locally via Docker containers
**** See: https://github.com/memex-explorer/image_space#quickstart
     Note: This method uses the CPU to compute image descriptors, meaning that this is not a scalable approach    
* Hackathon API
**** There is an API available to query for similar images to the ones you upload
**** Sample data from the Cornell/DANY Hackathon is loaded for testing
**** API information and credentials available from @danlamanna
